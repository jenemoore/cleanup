Experimenting with cleaning up old and messy code for a public library website

## History
This website was launched in early 2012, after more than a year of tweaking and adjustment; it was not designed to be mobile-responsive and relied heavily on repeating graphics and Javascript. The site was intended to be retired in 2019, but a number of staffing delays pushed the new site launch back and then COVID meant that we had to return to this site under pretty intensive use. Since I've had to spend so much time in this code, I figured I might as well clean it up as best I could, as invisibly as possible (so I didn't have to get approval to make changes).

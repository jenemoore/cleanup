 <p><strong>Laugh. Learn. Escape. Improve. Question. Feel.</strong> Whatever your reason for reading, this summer read for a cause!</p>
<p>Turning your summer reading into a reward for your community is as easy as 1-2-3.
<br/><br/>
	&nbsp;1. Read and listen to whatever books you choose.<br/>
	&nbsp;2. Log your reading and listening.<br/>
	&nbsp;3. Tell us which of these not for profit organizations you would like to receive a $1 donation for each of your completed reading logs:</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://literacydupage.org/">Literacy DuPage</a> <br/> <a href="https://studentexcellencefoundation.org/">Student Excellence Foundation</a> <br/> <a href="https://www.outreachcommunityministries.org/wyfs/">Warrenville Youth and Family Services</a> <br/> <a href="https://www.naperhumane.org/">Naperville Area Humane Society</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children (Under 11): 6 hours = 1 completed reading log</p>
<p>Teens (12-17): 5 books = 1 completed reading log</p>
<p>Adults: 5 books = 1 completed reading log</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To participate in Read for a Cause, you need to be a Warrenville Public Library cardholder. Warrenville Public Library District residents can apply for a library card <a href="https://www.warrenville.com/blog/index.php/get-a-wpld-library-card/">here.</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get your summer reading materials, use our <a href="https://wpld.info/curbside">Curbside Pickup service</a> or download books for free from <a href="https://emedialibrary.overdrive.com/emedialibrary-warrenville/content/">OverDrive/Libby</a>, <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/">Hoopla</a> and <a href="../reading/emedia.php#tumblebooks">TumbleBooks</a>. Swap books with friends or borrow from Warrenville’s Little Free Library locations. Get help selecting reading materials from our librarians by filling out a <a href="https://warrenville.libnet.info/discover">Discover Your Next Read form</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because you can't visit the library right now to drop off your reading logs, you can easily <strong>submit completed logs <a href="https://warrenville.libnet.info/read-for-a-cause">online</a></strong>. If you’d rather use a paper log to track your books or time (for youth 0-11), you can access <a href="https://warrenville.libnet.info/read-for-a-cause#forms">printable forms</a> that include directions for submission. Record your reading from July 1-August 15, and submit your logs by August 22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donations to our participating organizations are funded by a gift to Warrenville Public Library District from the estate of Warrenville resident Alba Lemos. Total donations limited to $2,500.</p>

Notes:

--why do we not believe in letting people see what links they've visited?
--convert to css grid
--change most ids to classes - work out the selection issues
--use semantic tags: header, nav, main, section, article, footer; figure & figcaption if captions are necessary; time
    --header and footer can also be used inside article
    --use dl (description list) with dt (description title) and dd (description data) for resource links
    --hgroup groups subheadings together when they appear one right after the other, no content in between
    --i used for italics used for semantic reasons; em used for emphasis
    --b used for keywords, strong used for emphasis
    --address
    --div vs span: use div when no other content tag is appropriate; span inherets meaning from its children
    --use br for significant content breaks, not for styling
    --link to telephone numbers: <a href="tel:+1....">

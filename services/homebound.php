<h4>Homebound Delivery Service</h4>
<p>  Are  you homebound and unable to visit the Library? Let us bring the Library to you!  Free home delivery is provided to anyone who lives in the Warrenville Public  Library District and is homebound due to temporary or permanent illness or  disability and who is unable to visit the Library for 30 days or more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Books,  audiobooks, DVDs, music CDs and magazines will be dropped off and picked up  twice a month by Library staff or screened volunteers. No fines are  charged for overdue items, but patrons are responsible for lost items. If you  do not have a Warrenville Library card, an application will be brought to you  on the day of the first delivery. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have questions or wish to sign up for  this service, please call Circulation Manager Patty Dybala at 630/393-1171  x102.</p>

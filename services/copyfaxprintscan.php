The Library  does not offer additional paper sizes or types and patrons may <strong>not</strong> insert their own paper.

  <strong>Printing from the Library&rsquo;s  Computers</strong><br>
  Standard  Windows printing options are available within Microsoft Office, Internet  Explorer and Firefox, or specific websites. A pop-up box will confirm the  number of pages being printed and the total cost.

Print jobs will be available  at the Print Station under the same library card number used to log on to the computer.</p>

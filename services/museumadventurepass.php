<h3>Services &gt;  Museum Adventure Pass</h3>

<p>Warrenville Public Library District cardholders can receive   free admission to exciting museums and cultural institutions throughout the   Chicago area. Visit the Library to pick up a one-week pass for the museum of   your choice. Passes are available on a first come, first   served basis.</p>
